# vidtracker -- abandoned

I use a newer version of this tool now. While you might refer to this repo to try to learn about some various things, you should know that I do not use this repo as-is anymore, and have not for a long time.

## Requirements:

* sqlite3
* a config.ini that contains...
    * location of your videos
    * the executable you will use

Like so:
```
[vidtracker]
dir=/home/user/Videos
exe=vlc
```
